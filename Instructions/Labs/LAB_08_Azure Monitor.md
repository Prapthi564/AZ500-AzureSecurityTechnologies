# Lab 08: Azure Monitor

## Lab scenario
You have been asked to create a proof of concept for monitoring virtual machine performance. Specifically, you want to:
- Configure a virtual machine such that telemetry and logs can be collected.
- Show what telemetry and logs can be collected.
- Show how the data can be used and queried. 

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:
- Exercise 1: Collect data from an Azure virtual machine with Azure Monitor

## Estimated timing: 45 minutes

# Exercise 1: Collect data from an Azure virtual machine with Azure Monitor

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks: 

- Task 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine 
- Task 2: Create a Log Analytics workspace
- Task 3: Enable the Log Analytics virtual machine extension
- Task 4: Collect virtual machine event and performance data
- Task 5: View and query collected data 

## Task 1: Deploy an Azure virtual machine

1. From the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. In the upper-left menu of the Cloud Shell pane, make sure you are using **Powershell**. If not selected select **Switch to Powershell**. In **Switch to Powershell in Cloud Shell** pop-up select **Confirm**.

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a resource group that will be used in this lab:
  
    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name AZ500LAB080910 -Location 'EastUS'
    ```

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a new Azure virtual machine. 

    ```powershell
    New-AzVm -ResourceGroupName "AZ500LAB080910" -Name "myVM" -Location 'EastUS' -VirtualNetworkName "myVnet" -SubnetName "mySubnet" -SecurityGroupName   "myNetworkSecurityGroup" -PublicIpAddressName "myPublicIpAddress" -OpenPorts 80,3389
    ```

1.  When prompted for credentials:

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |User name|**localadmin**|
    |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete. 

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to confirm that the virtual machine named **myVM** was created and its **ProvisioningState** is **Succeeded**.

    ```powershell
    Get-AzVM -Name 'myVM' -ResourceGroupName 'AZ500LAB080910' | Format-Table
    ```

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane. 

## Task 2: Create a Log Analytics workspace

In this task, you will create a Log Analytics workspace. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Log Analytics workspaces** and press the **Enter** key.

   ![](../images/New-image111.png)

1. On the **Log Analytics workspaces** blade, click **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create Log Analytics workspace** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Subscription|the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab|
    |Resource group|**AZ500LAB080910**|
    |Name|any valid, globally unique name|
    |Region|**(US) East US**|

1. Click **Review + create**.

   ![](../images/New-image112.png)
   
1. On the **Review + create** tab of the **Create Log Analytics workspace** blade, click **Create**.

## Task 3: Create an Azure storage account

In this task, you will create a storage account.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Storage accounts** and press the **Enter** key.

   ![](../images/New-image113.png)

2. On the **Storage accounts** blade in the Azure portal, click the **+ Create** button to create a new storage account.

    ![](../images/New-image114.png)

3. On the **Basics** tab of the **Create storage account** blade, specify the following settings (leave others with their default values):

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |Subscription|the name of the Azure subscription you are using in this lab|
    |Resource group|**AZ500LAB080910**|
    |Storage account name|any globally unique name between 3 and 24 in length consisting of letters and digits|
    |Location|**(US) EastUS**|
    |Performance|**Standard (general-purpose v2 account)**|
    |Redundency|**Locally redundant storage (LRS)**|
