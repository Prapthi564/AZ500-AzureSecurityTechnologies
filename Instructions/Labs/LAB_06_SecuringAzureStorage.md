# Lab 06: Service Endpoints and Securing Storage

## Lab scenario

In this lab scenario, you are tasked with creating a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate securing Azure file shares. The PoC will involve setting up a storage endpoint to ensure that all traffic to Azure Storage remains within the Azure backbone network. Additionally, you will configure the storage endpoint to allow access only from resources within a specific subnet, while verifying that resources outside of this subnet are unable to access the storage, thereby ensuring enhanced security for the Azure file shares.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

## Estimated timing: 45 minutes

## Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

In this exercise, you will create a virtual network, add a subnet, and configure a storage endpoint. You will then set up network security groups to restrict subnet access and allow RDP on the public subnet, followed by creating a storage account with a file share and deploying virtual machines into subnets. Finally, you will test storage connections from the private subnet to confirm access is allowed, and from the public subnet to ensure access is denied.

### Task 1: Create a virtual network

In this task, you will create a virtual network.

    |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the Remote Desktop session to open and Server Manager to load.

    >**Note**: You will now map drive Z to an Azure File share within the Remote Desktop session to a Windows Server 2022 computer

5. Within the Remote Desktop session to **myVMPrivate**, click **Start** and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

6. Within the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, open the **Script** pane, then paste and run the PowerShell script that you recorded earlier in this lab.The script has the following format:

    ```powershell
    $connectTestResult = Test-NetConnection -ComputerName <storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net -Port 445
    if ($connectTestResult.TcpTestSucceeded) {
       # Save the password so the drive will persist on reboot
       cmd.exe /C "cmdkey /add:`"<storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net`" /user:`"localhost\<storage_account_name>`"  /pass:`"<storage_account_key>`""
       # Mount the drive
       New-PSDrive -Name Z -PSProvider FileSystem -Root "\\<storage_account_name>.file.core.windows.net\my-file-share" -Persist
    } else {
       Write-Error -Message "Unable to reach the Azure storage account via port 445. Check to make sure your organization or ISP is not blocking port 445, or use Azure P2S VPN, Azure S2S VPN, or Express Route to tunnel SMB traffic over a different port."
    }
    ```
    >**Note**: The `<storage_account_name>` placeholder represents the name of the storage account hosting the file share and `<storage_account_key>` one its primary key

7. Start File Explorer and verify that the Z: drive mapping has been successfully created.

8. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has no outbound connectivity to the internet:

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    >**Note**: The test will fail because the network security group associated with the Private subnet does not allow outbound access to the internet.

9. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Private subnet can access the storage account. 

###  Task 8: Test the storage connection from the public subnet to confirm that access is denied 

1. Navigate back to the **Virtual machines** blade. 

2. On the **Virtual machines** blade, click the **myVMPublic** entry.

3. On the **myVMPublic** blade, click **Connect** and, in the drop down menu, click **RDP**.

    |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the Remote Desktop session to open and Server Manager to load.

    >**Note**: You will now map drive Z to an Azure File share within the Remote Desktop session to a Windows Server 2022 computer

5. Within the Remote Desktop session to **myVMPublic**, click **Start** and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**.

6. Within the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, open the **Script** pane, then paste and run the same PowerShell script that you ran within the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: This time, you will receive the **New-PSDrive : Access is denied** error. 

    >**Note**: Access is denied because the *myVmPublic* virtual machine is deployed in the Public subnet. The Public subnet does not have a service endpoint enabled for the Azure Storage. The storage account only allows network access from the Private subnet.

7. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has outbound connectivity to the internet: 

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    >**Note**: The test will succeed because there is no network security group associated with the Public subnet.

8. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPublic** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Public subnet cannot access the storage account, but has access to the internet.
