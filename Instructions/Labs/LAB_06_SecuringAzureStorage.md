# Lab 06: Service Endpoints and Securing Storage

## Lab scenario

In this lab scenario, you are tasked with creating a proof of concept (PoC) to demonstrate securing Azure file shares. The PoC will involve setting up a storage endpoint to ensure that all traffic to Azure Storage remains within the Azure backbone network. Additionally, you will configure the storage endpoint to allow access only from resources within a specific subnet, while verifying that resources outside of this subnet are unable to access the storage, thereby ensuring enhanced security for the Azure file shares.

> For all the resources in this lab, we are using the **East US** region.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following exercise:

- Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

## Estimated timing: 45 Minutes

## Architecture Diagram

![Architecture diagram](../images/arch-az-500-lab6.png)

## Exercise 1: Service endpoints and security storage

In this exercise, you will create a virtual network, add a subnet, and configure a storage endpoint. You will then set up network security groups to restrict subnet access and allow RDP on the public subnet, followed by creating a storage account with a file share and deploying virtual machines into subnets. Finally, you will test storage connections from the private subnet to confirm access is allowed, and from the public subnet to ensure access is denied.

### Task 1: Create a virtual network

In this task, you will create a virtual network.

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Virtual networks (1)** and select **Virtual networks (2)** from the services.

1. Click on **Go to resources**.    

     ![image](../images/AZ-500-l6-3.png)

### Task 2: Add a subnet to the virtual network and configure a storage endpoint

1. Start File Explorer and verify that the Z: drive mapping has been successfully created.

    ![image](../images/az500lab12-44.png)   

1. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has no outbound connectivity to the internet:

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    ![image](../images/az500lab12-45.png)       

    >**Note**: The test will fail because the network security group associated with the Private subnet does not allow outbound access to the internet.

1. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Private subnet can access the storage account. 

###  Task 8: Test the storage connection from the public subnet to confirm that access is denied 

1. Navigate back to the **Virtual machines** blade. 

1. On the **Compute infrastructure | Virtual machines** blade, click the **myVMPublic** entry.

1. On the **myVMPublic** blade, click **Connect (2)** and, in the drop down menu, click **Connect (1)**. 

    ![image](../images/AZ-500-l6-33.png) 

1. Click **Download RDP File** and use it to connect to the **myVMPublic** Azure VM via Remote Desktop.

1. On the **Windows Security** pop up, click on **More choices.**

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-39.png)  

1. Select **Use a different account.**

   ![image](../images/az500lab7-40.png)  

1. When prompted to authenticate, provide the following credentials and then click **OK**.

    |Setting|Value|
    |---|---|
    |User name|**localadmin**|
    |Password|**Pa55w.rd1234**|

    >**Note**: Wait for the Remote Desktop session to open and Server Manager to load.

    >**Note**: You will now map drive Z to an Azure File share within the Remote Desktop session to a Windows Server 2022 computer

1. In the **Remote Desktop Connection** security warning dialog, click **Yes**.    

    ![image](../images/AZ-500-l6-36.png) 

1. Within the Remote Desktop session to **myVMPublic**, type **Windows PowerShell ISE (1)** in the Start menu search box, and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE (2)** from the results.

    ![image](../images/AZ-500-l6-39.png) 

1. Within the **Windows PowerShell ISE** window, open the **Script** pane by clickin on **File->New** from the top left corner. Then **paste and run the same PowerShell script** that you ran within the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPrivate** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: This time, you will receive the **New-PSDrive : Access is denied** error. 

    ![image](../images/az500lab12-49.png)       

     >**Note**: Access is denied because the *myVmPublic* virtual machine is deployed in the Public subnet. The Public subnet does not have a service endpoint enabled for the Azure Storage. The storage account only allows network access from the Private subnet.

1. Next, from the console pane of the **Windows PowerShell ISE** console, run the following to verify that the virtual machine has outbound connectivity to the internet: 

    ```powershell
    Test-NetConnection -ComputerName www.bing.com -Port 80
    ```

    ![image](../images/az500lab12-48.png)       

    >**Note**: The test will succeed because there is no network security group associated with the Public subnet.

1. Terminate the Remote Desktop session to the **myVMPublic** Azure VM.

    >**Note**: At this point, you have confirmed that the virtual machine in the Public subnet cannot access the storage account, but has access to the internet.
