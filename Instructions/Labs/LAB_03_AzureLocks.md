## Exercise 1: Resource Manager Locks

In this exercise, you will complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Create a storage account.
- Task 2: Add a ReadOnly lock on the storage account. 
- Task 3: Test the ReadOnly lock. 
- Task 4: Remove the ReadOnly lock and create a Delete lock.
- Task 5: Test the Delete lock.

### Task 1: Create a storage account

In this task, you will create a storage account for the lab.

1. Once you have signed in to Azure Portal close all the notifications and use the **Cloud Shell** button **[\>_]** to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal. The first time you open the Cloud Shell, you may be prompted to choose the type of shell you want to use (*Bash* or *PowerShell*). Select **PowerShell**. If you do not see this option, skip the step.

1. If you are prompted to create storage for your Cloud Shell, ensure your subscription is selected and click on **show advanced settings**. Please make sure you have selected your resource group **AZ500LAB03-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and enter **storage<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** for the **Storage account name** and enter **fileshare<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** For the **File share name**, then click on **Create Storage**.

   >**Note**: It might take about a minute for the Cloud Shell pane to show up.

1. Ensure **PowerShell** is selected in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

1. In the PowerShell session within the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create a storage account in the newly created resource group:
    
    ```powershell
    New-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName AZ500LAB03-[DeploymentID] -Name [storageAccountName] -Location  EastUS -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2 
    ```
   
   
   >**Note**: In the above code snippet, replace the **[DeploymentID]** with **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**, and **[storageAccountName]** **strgacc<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.The following image is provided for your reference.

   >**Note**: Wait until the storage account is created. This might take a couple of minutes. 

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

### Task 2: Add a ReadOnly lock on the storage account 

In this task, you will add a read-only lock to the storage account. This will protect the resource from accidental deletion or modification. 

1. In the Azure portal, in the **Search resources, services, and docs** text box at the top of the Azure portal page, type **Resource groups** and press the **Enter** key.

1. On the **Resource groups** blade, select the **AZ500LAB03-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group entry.
   
1. On the **AZ500LAB03-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group blade, in the list of resources, select the new storage account **strgacc<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**.
  
1. Under the **Settings** section in the left navigation pane, click on the **Locks** icon.

1. Click on **+ Add** and specify the following settings:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Lock name|**ReadOnly Lock**|
   |Lock type|**Read-only**|

1. Click on **OK**. 

   >**Note**:  The storage account is now protected from accidental deletion and modification.

### Task 3: Test the ReadOnly lock 

1. In the **Settings** section of the storage account blade, click on **Configuration**.

1. Set the **Secure transfer required** option to **Disabled** and then click on **Save**.

1. You should be able to spot a notification stating **Failed to update storage account**.

1. Click on the **Notifications** icon in the toolbar at the top of the Azure portal and review the notification, which will resemble the following text: 

   >**"Failed to update storage account 'xxxxxxxx'. Error: The scope 'xxxxxxxx' cannot perform write operation because following scope(s) are locked: '/subscriptions/xxxxx-xxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/AZ500LAB03/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/xxxxxxx'. Please remove the lock and try again"**

1. Return the **Configuration** blade of the storage account and click on **Discard**. 

1. On the storage account blade, select **Overview** and, on the **Overview** blade, click on **Delete**.

1. On the **Delete storage account** blade, we notice that the delete button is disabled with the following warning sign :

   >**'storage-acc-name' can't be deleted because this resource or its parent has a lock. Locks must be removed before this resource can be deleted.**
	
   >**Note**:  You have now verified that a ReadOnly lock will stop accidental deletion and modification of a resource.

### Task 4: Remove the ReadOnly lock and create a Delete lock

In this task, you remove the ReadOnly lock from the storage account and create a Delete lock. 

1. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade displaying properties of the newly created storage account.

1. In the **Settings** section, select **Locks**.  

1. On the **Locks** blade, click on the **Delete** icon on the far right of the **ReadOnly Lock** entry.

   >**Note**: Please refresh the page if ReadOnly Lock entry is listed.

1. Click on **+ Add** and specify the following settings:

   |Setting|Value|
   |---|---|
   |Lock name|**Delete Lock**|
   |Lock type|**Delete**|

1. Click on **OK**. 

### Task 5: Test the Delete lock

In this task, you will test the Delete lock. You should be able to modify the storage account, but not delete it. 

1. In the **Settings** section of the storage account blade, click on **Configuration**.

2. Set the **Secure transfer required** option to **Disabled** and then click on **Save**.

   >**Note**:  This time, the change should be successful.

3. On the storage account blade, select **Overview** and, on the **Overview** blade, click on **Delete**.

4. On the **Delete storage account** blade, we notice that the delete button is disabled with the following warning sign :

   >**'storage-acc-name' can't be deleted because this resource or its parent has a delete lock. Locks must be removed before this resource can be deleted.**

   >**Note**:  You have now verified that a **Delete** lock will allow configuration changes but stop accidental deletion.

   >**Note**:  By using Resource Locks you can implement an extra line of defense against accidental or malicious changes and/or deletion of the most important resources. Resource locks can be removed by any user with the **Owner** role, but doing so requires a conscious effort. Locks supplement Role Based Access Control. 

5. In the Azure portal, navigate back to the blade displaying properties of the newly created storage account.

6. In the **Settings** section, select **Locks**.  

7. On the **Locks** blade, click on the **Delete** icon on the far right of the **Delete Lock** entry.

   >**Note**: Please refresh the page once **Delete Lock** is deleted.

   > **Results:** In this exercise, you learned to use Resource Manager locks to protect resources from modification and accidental deletion.

> **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
   - If you receive a success message, you can proceed to the next task.
   - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
